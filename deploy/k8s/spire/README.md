# Kubernetes SPIRE deployment design

This directory replaces the Compose-era SPIRE topology with a Kubernetes design
that is credible in reviewer Q&A without claiming that the repo has already
performed a production rollout.

## Scope

- `server/`: 3-replica SPIRE Server StatefulSet, services, config, RBAC, and PVCs
- `agent/`: node-local SPIRE Agent DaemonSet and Workload API socket exposure
- `csi-driver/`: SPIFFE CSI driver for pod-mounted X.509 SVIDs
- `registration/`: sample workload registrations for the Ardur demo frameworks

## Design prerequisites

These manifests are intentionally incomplete as a real deploy bundle. The
cluster operator still needs to provide:

1. A reachable PostgreSQL instance and a Secret named
   `spire-server-datastore` in `spire-system` with key `connection_string`.
1. A Secret named `spire-upstream-ca` in `spire-system` with:
   - `tls.crt`: upstream CA certificate or intermediate chain
   - `tls.key`: upstream CA private key
   - `ca.crt`: upstream root bundle
1. Node labels and namespace labels that match the selectors described in
   `registration/ardur-workloads.yaml`.
1. The SPIRE controller manager CRDs if you want to apply
   `ClusterSPIFFEID` objects directly.

## Install order

Apply the manifests in this order:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/spire/server/serviceaccount.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/spire/server/rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/spire/server/configmap.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/spire/server/service.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/spire/server/statefulset.yaml

kubectl apply -f k8s/spire/agent/serviceaccount.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/spire/agent/rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/spire/agent/configmap.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/spire/agent/daemonset.yaml

kubectl apply -f k8s/spire/csi-driver/rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/spire/csi-driver/daemonset.yaml

# Optional: only after spire-controller-manager is installed
kubectl apply -f k8s/spire/registration/ardur-workloads.yaml
```

## Workload consumption model

The preferred workload integration is the SPIFFE CSI driver. A pod consumes it
with an inline ephemeral volume similar to:

```yaml
volumes:
- name: spiffe
  csi:
    driver: csi.spiffe.io
    readOnly: true

volumeMounts:
- name: spiffe
  mountPath: /var/run/secrets/spiffe.io
  readOnly: true
```

That keeps the private key lifecycle tied to the pod lifecycle and avoids
teaching every workload to talk directly to the Workload API socket.

## Validation plan

After deploy, validate in this order:

1. Confirm all three server pods are healthy and share the same datastore:

```bash
kubectl -n spire-system get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=spire-server
kubectl -n spire-system logs statefulset/spire-server --tail=50
```

2. Confirm bundle publication is working:

```bash
kubectl -n spire-system get configmap spire-bundle -o yaml
kubectl -n spire-system exec spire-server-0 -- \
  /opt/spire/bin/spire-server bundle show
```

3. Confirm node attestation:

```bash
kubectl -n spire-system exec spire-server-0 -- \
  /opt/spire/bin/spire-server entry show
kubectl -n spire-system exec spire-server-0 -- \
  /opt/spire/bin/spire-server agent list
```

4. Confirm workload API reachability on a node:

```bash
AGENT_POD=$(kubectl -n spire-system get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=spire-agent -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl -n spire-system exec "$AGENT_POD" -- \
  /opt/spire/bin/spire-agent api fetch -socketPath /run/spire/agent-sockets/agent.sock
```

5. Confirm registration entries reconcile:

```bash
kubectl get clusterspiffeid
kubectl describe clusterspiffeid ardur-langchain
```

## Trust bundle rotation walkthrough

The rotation path is:

1. SPIRE server rotates or renews its intermediate CA from the disk-based
   upstream authority.
1. The server updates its own bundle state in the shared datastore.
1. The `k8sbundle` notifier rewrites the `spire-bundle` ConfigMap in
   `spire-system`.
1. SPIRE agents consume the updated bundle and continue serving the current
   bundle over the Workload API.
1. Workloads using the CSI driver see the renewed material through the mounted
   volume; workloads using the Workload API directly fetch the new bundle on
   their next read.

## Rollback plan

If the deployment needs to be backed out:

1. Remove registration CRs or delete the equivalent SPIRE entries first so
   workloads stop depending on new identities.
1. Remove the CSI driver DaemonSet and `CSIDriver` object.
1. Remove the agent DaemonSet.
1. Remove the server StatefulSet and services.
1. Keep the PostgreSQL snapshot and the PVCs until you decide whether you are
   rolling forward again or discarding the trust domain state permanently.

## Operational TODOs before a real cluster rollout

- Replace the placeholder `ardur.demo` trust domain and `ardur-demo`
  cluster name.
- Back the upstream CA Secret with your real PKI rotation process.
- Add PodDisruptionBudgets, NetworkPolicies, and secret delivery automation.
- Decide whether controller-managed `ClusterSPIFFEID` reconciliation or
  explicit `spire-server entry create` automation is the production path.
