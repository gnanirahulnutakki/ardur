# Ardur Agent Instructions

These instructions are mandatory for coding agents working in this repository.

## First Action In Every New Session

Run the Conductor bootstrap before doing task-specific work:

```bash
./scripts/conductor-bootstrap.sh
```

Then read `.context/ARDUR_CONTEXT.md` and `.context/ardur-graph.md`. The JSON
graph at `.context/ardur-graph.json` is the machine-readable map of the repo.

If the bootstrap fails, stop and inspect the failure before editing files. A
failed bootstrap usually means the local toolchain, branch state, or generated
context is not trustworthy yet.

## Workspace Contract

- Work from the current branch. Do not rename it.
- Use `origin/dev` as the default diff and PR base for normal development work.
- Treat `dev` as the integration branch where new improvements land first.
- Treat `main` as release-only: only tested, verified, public-facing work should
  be promoted there from `dev`.
- If a Conductor workspace was created from `origin/main`, keep the branch name
  unchanged but target the resulting PR/merge at `dev` unless the user says this
  is a release-promotion task.
- Preserve user work in progress. Do not reset, checkout, clean, or revert
  unrelated local changes unless the user explicitly asks for that operation.
- Generated session and graph artifacts belong under `.context/`, which is
  intentionally ignored by git.
- Private/local skills belong under `.context/skills/`, `.agents/`, or
  `.local-skills/` only. They must not be committed to the open source repo.

## Repo Truth Hierarchy

Use live repo state over stale prose.

1. `git status`, branch refs, and the actual files in this checkout.
2. `.github/workflows/` for the current CI surface.
3. `README.md`, `STATUS.md`, `docs/public-import-plan.md`, `docs/TESTING.md`,
   `docs/engineering-standards.md`, and `docs/decisions/`.
4. Prior notes and generated `.context/` files, after checking their timestamp.

If two sources conflict, cite the conflict and verify from the current tree.
For example, this repo has changed quickly around Python and Go CI; the live
workflow files are the authority for what currently runs.

## Engineering Defaults

- Agent-specific public guides live under `docs/agent-instructions/`:
  `conductor.md`, `codex.md`, and `claude.md`. They share the same contract and
  only differ where the runtime needs different startup or local-state handling.
- Follow `docs/engineering-standards.md` for foundation, testing, review,
  release, security, and AI-agent work rules.
- Keep public claims evidence-backed: command, test, artifact, verifier path, or
  explicit limitation.
- Keep public product naming as `Ardur`. Preserve protocol/source names such as
  `VIBAP`, `MCEP`, `SPIFFE`, `SPIRE`, `Biscuit`, `Cedar`, `AAT`, and `EAT`
  where they describe real technical artifacts.
- Do not hardcode secrets, local private paths, or generated credentials.
- Prefer small, reviewable changes with targeted tests.
- For runtime changes, run the relevant Python and/or Go checks before claiming
  success.

## Private Skills And Local Instructions

Public, repo-safe agent instructions live in this tracked `AGENTS.md` file.
Everything else is local-only:

- `.ardur/` and `.vibap/` for runtime state, generated receipts, sockets, and
  local key material. These paths are allowlisted in `.gitleaks.toml` only so
  tests can run before the local secret scan; they must stay untracked.
- `.context/skills/` for Conductor/session skills and notes.
- `.agents/` for local agent runtimes that expect that folder name.
- `.local-skills/` for imported or experimental local skills.
- `.ai-context/`, `.agent-context/`, `.codex/`, and `.claude/` for
  tool-specific private state.
- `HANDOFF.md` and `workdone-so-far.md` for local-only handoff notes.

Never force-add files from those paths. `scripts/check-local.sh --quick` and
the `secret-scan` workflow both fail if any local-only agent path becomes
tracked.

## Local Commands

```bash
# Generate fresh Conductor context and graph.
./scripts/conductor-bootstrap.sh

# Create/update local Python dev env and check Go toolchain.
./scripts/setup-dev.sh

# Fast local validation.
./scripts/check-local.sh --quick

# Full local validation when the toolchain is ready.
./scripts/check-local.sh --full
```
