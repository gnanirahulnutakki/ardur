## Bounded Or In Progress

{{< proof-status state="archival" label="Archival media only" source="MEDIA.md" >}}
The current recordings are asciinema `.cast` files. They are useful
product-direction media, but they are not rerunnable public proof until stable
verifier commands and artifact paths land. The current rerunnable Phase 1
evidence path is the no-key JSON bundle, not these archival casts.

{{< proof-status state="hold" label="Not a packaged production release" source="STATUS.md" >}}
PyPI/Homebrew/OCI distribution, broader cluster deployment material, and
rerunnable public proof media are still being hardened.
