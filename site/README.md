# Ardur Public Evidence Site

This Hugo project renders Ardur's public evidence and documentation surface.
It is a publishing layer over the root repo, not a replacement for the source
docs.

## Local preview

```sh
hugo server --source site --buildDrafts
```

The standard Hugo edition is enough; this site does not require Sass or Hugo
Extended.

## Validation

```sh
python3 site/scripts/sync_source_docs.py --check
python3 site/scripts/validate_claims.py
hugo --source site --gc --minify
```

`validate_claims.py` fails when a claim card is missing required evidence
metadata or points at a repo path that does not exist.

`sync_source_docs.py` generates the `site/content/source/` mirrors from all
public Markdown files in the repo, including root docs, articles, package
READMEs, examples, deployment notes, testing/security docs, and contributor
process docs. It excludes generated site content, local review context, and
dependency/vendor directories. The script also copies the media capability
catalog into Hugo data and mirrors structured documentation artifacts under
`site/static/repo/` so schemas, mission examples, example helper source files,
casts, and deployment manifests can be reached from the site without leaving
for GitHub. Run it
without `--check` after editing public docs.

Rendered GitHub source links use `params.sourceRef`. Local builds default to
`dev`; CI sets `HUGO_PARAMS_SOURCEREF` to the exact commit SHA so deployed
provenance points at the commit that produced the site.
