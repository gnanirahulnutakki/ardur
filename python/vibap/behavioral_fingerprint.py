"""Behavioral fingerprinting at session start.

Research direction 1 (see docs/research/NOVEL-RESEARCH-DIRECTIONS-
2026-04-19.md). Closes the 'right crypto identity, wrong behavioral
identity' gap that no competing framework even frames as a gap today.

## The threat this closes

An attacker who controls the build pipeline (poisoned Dockerfile, swapped
system prompt, replaced LoRA adapter) can ship a container whose SPIFFE
identity is correct, whose Biscuit mission is signed validly, AND whose
actual behavior diverges from the expected model. Ardur's runtime
governance catches the observable side effects — the attacker eventually
tries a forbidden tool and gets denied. But the poisoned model has been
processing the user's data through an adversary-controlled pipeline for
the intervening steps.

## The mechanism

At session start, the proxy poses a short set of **canary challenges** —
questions whose answers behaviorally fingerprint the specific
(base_model, fine_tune_adapter, system_prompt) combination. The proxy
hashes the responses and compares against a per-model expected
fingerprint registered in the fingerprint registry. Mismatch → session
refused BEFORE any real tool call fires.

## Adversarial robustness

Three design points keep this honest:

1. **Canary pools rotate.** The proxy picks N challenges from a pool of
   M (N << M); an attacker who only sees one issuance can't enumerate
   the entire pool. Attackers who control a long-running session can
   observe responses, but responses are hashed per-challenge, so the
   attacker sees only ``sha256(response)``, not the response text.

2. **Temperature-zero semantic canaries, not output-exact.** We ask for
   short categorical answers (1-2 words) where benign Claude produces
   one answer deterministically and a jailbroken model produces
   something else. E.g., the canonical refusal word, a specific word
   count, a classification outcome.

3. **Fail-open by default; fail-closed per policy.** The env gate
   ``ARDUR_BEHAVIORAL_FINGERPRINT`` controls activation. Unset →
   no challenge issued (backward-compatible). Set to ``anthropic`` →
   issued and a mismatch rejects the session. Operators who want the
   strongest posture set it; noisy first-party dev environments don't.

## Integration with Lane E (semantic_judge)

The sibling's `semantic_judge` Lane E has the same shape: an
env-gated Anthropic-backed advisor called during session life. A
future consolidation could unify both under one `anthropic_advisor`
subsystem. For now they stay separate — fingerprinting is session-
start-gate (blocking); semantic judging is per-tool-call advisory
(non-blocking).

## Non-goals

- Not training-data attribution (that's a different problem — see
  Shokri et al.)
- Not detecting model-version drift silently pushed by providers —
  closest related direction 3 (training-time attestation).
- Not replacing Biscuit SPIFFE binding. This is a LAYER, not a
  substitute: a passing SPIFFE + Biscuit check is necessary but no
  longer sufficient when fingerprinting is enabled.
