"""Mission-id-keyed policy store for Cedar + forbid_rules + other
backend specs.

Why this exists
---------------
Biscuit credentials intentionally do NOT carry policy specs as Datalog
facts. Policy is server-side state — it changes at a different cadence
than identity (policies are revised by the security team; identity is
bound to the workload). Mixing them creates two problems:

1. Policy churn requires re-issuing credentials to every running
   agent — practically unshippable.
2. If the credential carried the policy, anyone who steals the
   credential also has the policy — the attacker can plan around
   the exact rules they need to evade.

The production flow is therefore: credential names the mission
(stable ID), proxy looks up current policies for that mission at
session-start time from an authoritative store.

This module defines the minimal `PolicyStore` Protocol the proxy
expects, plus `InMemoryPolicyStore` for tests and demos.

Previously the live-governance demo mutated `session.passport_claims
["additional_policies"]` AFTER session start, which was called out in
the 2026-04-17 external-review-X review:

> additional_policies are being injected by mutating live session state
> after session start ... the Cedar/forbid_rules layer is neither
> signed into the Biscuit nor loaded from an authoritative store.
> Anyone with a session handle can swap policy after the SPIFFE/
> Biscuit checks have already passed.

With `PolicyStore` the proxy loads policies into the session's
`passport_claims` BEFORE the session is cached, so downstream code
(`check_and_record`, receipt generation) sees the same server-
authoritative policy set every call.
