# Tokenizer hint sets (C3)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The tokenizer uses key-name hints to decide how to extract resource
# references from a raw argument value. Two classes of hints:
#
#   - PATH hints: the author labeled this key as carrying a file/URL. Under
#     a path hint, a bare value (no whitespace) is treated as one token
#     even if it doesn't match the usual path shape (e.g. ``q1.csv``). If
#     the value contains whitespace (e.g. ``command`` → ``cat /etc/passwd``),
#     we split and keep only path-shaped tokens — this is B6 closure.
#
#   - PROSE hints: the author labeled this key as carrying free-form text.
#     Tokens are extracted by whitespace split + path-shape filter. The
#     shape rule uses the punctuation-vs-separator heuristic: ``/``
#     surrounded by letters-only segments on both sides (``and/or``,
#     ``his/her``) is grammatical and NOT extracted. This is B3 closure.
#     A real path under a prose key (``see /etc/passwd for details``) is
#     extracted because ``/etc/passwd`` has an empty leading segment — B5
#     closure.
#
# Env-var extension:
#   - ``VIBAP_SCOPE_PATH_HINTS`` and ``VIBAP_SCOPE_PROSE_HINTS`` (comma-
#     separated key names) EXTEND the defaults — callers cannot shrink the
#     defaults, only add to them. This matches the "false-DENY is
#     recoverable, false-PERMIT is a bypass" design principle.
#   - Conflict resolution: if a key appears in both env vars, PATH wins
#     (more aggressive scanning). Per unified delegation §1 decision 6.
#
# Hints are resolved per-check (not cached at import time) so tests and
# operators can flip env vars without reimporting the module.

    - If ``error_reason`` is non-None, the caller should DENY with that

    1. Null-byte rejection — a null byte in a path is never legitimate and

       letter is lowercased for case-insensitive matching on Windows

        substrings. Closes B6 — previously the whole value was one opaque
        token so ``/etc/*`` globs never matched.

    - **Prose hint** (``content``, ``body``, ``message``, ...):
      split on whitespace and keep path-shaped substrings. A narrow
      embedded-path rule also keeps pure-alpha path tokens like
      ``etc/passwd`` while still rejecting the known grammatical

       ``['/etc/passwd']`` (B6). ``/etc/passwd`` under ``markdown`` yields
       ``['/etc/passwd']`` (B5).
    3. **Layer 3 — sanitize + match** each token via ``_sanitize_value`` (NFC,
       Windows shapes, pre+post ``..`` escape check, ``posixpath.normpath``)
       then ``fnmatchcase`` against NFC-normalized scope patterns. If no

       any relative pattern → strip leading ``/``). Coerced forms still go

class Decision(str, Enum):
    """Tri-state governance decision for tool-call evaluation (B.2).

    The verifier MUST return exactly one of these for every evaluation.
    Callers MUST treat only PERMIT as allowing execution; all other
    states MUST block the tool call (Phase 3.3k fail-closed discipline).

    PERMIT
        The tool call is within declared scope, budget, and delegation
        policy. Safe to execute.

    DENY
        The tool call violates a mission-declared boundary:
        - tool not in allowed_tools / tool in forbidden_tools
        - resource path outside resource_scope patterns
        - budget exceeded (max_tool_calls / max_duration_s)
        - delegation not allowed or depth exhausted

    VIOLATION
        A governance invariant is broken:
        - Mission Declaration tampered (chain_invalid)
        - Passport revoked via status list
        - Memory integrity failure
        - Delegation chain splice detected
        These are MORE severe than DENY — they indicate the session's
        credentials are compromised, not just that one call is out of scope.

    INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE
        The verifier cannot make a confident decision:
        - Approval operator unavailable
        - State file corrupted / unavailable
        - Network error fetching Mission Declaration or status list
        Callers MUST treat this as DENY (fail-closed). The distinction
        exists so audit trails can separate "known bad" (DENY) from
        "uncertain" (INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE) for post-hoc analysis.

            #     scratch. If we don't re-seed additional_policies from
            #     the store here, the mission_ref path silently drops
            #     store-authoritative policies that start_session
            #     loaded — i.e. Cedar/forbid_rules composition for
            #     mission_ref sessions degrades to native-only.
            #   - Ops typically rotate PolicyStore content (security-
            #     team patches a forbid-rule, compliance updates a
            #     Cedar policy). For mission_ref sessions the
            #     intention is that the NEXT eval sees the new policy;
            #     per-call resolution delivers that.

            # those had additional_policies snapshotted into

        produces, and runs the rest of the session-start machinery
        (single-use jti check, lineage revocation check, persistence).

        Phase 5 integration (A1, 2026-04-17): when ``peer_jwt_svid`` and

            issuer_public_key: the ``biscuit_auth.PublicKey`` that signed
                the authority block. Verifier must already trust this
                key (e.g. by reading it from a SPIFFE federation trust
                bundle).
            audience: conventional ``aud`` claim for the synthesized
                session; defaults to ``"ardur-proxy"``.
            now: optional unix timestamp override for expiry checking.
            peer_jwt_svid: (optional) the JWT-SVID presented by the
                peer agent at connection time. If supplied, SPIFFE
                peer-identity binding is enforced.
            peer_trust_bundle: (optional, required when
