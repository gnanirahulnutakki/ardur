# LangGraph + Ardur quickstart

A LangGraph agent making tool calls through Ardur's governance proxy. The agent runs under an Ardur-issued mission credential, calls a small set of tools (read, write, summarize), and Ardur:

1. Issues a Mission Declaration signed by the local issuer key
2. Verifies the credential on every tool call against the mission's allowed tools, resource scope, and budget
3. Emits an Execution Receipt per call (compliant / violation / insufficient_evidence)
4. Produces a session-end attestation that's offline-verifiable with the issuer's public key

LangGraph's integration point is different from LangChain's: the verifier hooks into node transitions on the `StateGraph`, not the tool wrapper directly. That means cycles and conditional edges need receipts that carry the source/target node so the attestation stays linkable to the graph topology — receipts emit in node order, not call order.

## File layout

```
langgraph-quickstart/
├── README.md              # this file
└── demo.py                # the LangGraph agent + scenarios entrypoint
```

`demo.py` imports framework-agnostic helpers from [`examples/_shared/demo_scenes.py`](../_shared/demo_scenes.py). The LangGraph quickstart shares the LangChain Docker image (`rahulnutakki/ardur-demo:lang`) — both frameworks live in the same Python dependency stack, so a single image covers them.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.13+
- `python/` editable install (this repo, `pip install -e ../../python[dev]`)
- `langgraph ^0.2.0` plus the `langchain-*` family (already pulled by `[dev]` extras for the LangChain demo)
- LLM access: local Ollama, an OpenAI-compatible gateway, or an Anthropic API key
- Optional: Docker via the LangChain image (`rahulnutakki/ardur-demo:lang` runs this demo too — pass `demo.py` as the entrypoint)

## Running locally

```bash
cd ../../python && pip install -e '.[dev]'
export ARDUR_PROVIDER=ollama
export OLLAMA_MODEL='<your local model tag>'
cd ../examples/langgraph-quickstart
PYTHONPATH=../_shared python demo.py
```

`ARDUR_PROVIDER` plus the matching `*_MODEL` env var are required. No model identifiers are hard-coded — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Out of scope for this example

- Real-cluster SPIRE deployment — the example uses local file-based identity.
- Live LLM provider failover — single provider per run.
- Multi-tenant key isolation — single issuer key.
- Persistent checkpointing across runs (LangGraph supports it, but the example resets state each run for reproducible receipts).

For pure protocol exercising without the framework on top, see [`examples/missions/`](../missions/).
