# `ARDUR.md` Profile Format

The `ARDUR.md` profile is a plain-Markdown guardrail file that compiles into
the same Mission Passport the protocol path uses. It is the friendly layer
for non-technical users; nothing about a Markdown profile is missing from
the underlying capability set.

Source: [`python/vibap/ardur_profile.py`](../../python/vibap/ardur_profile.py).

## Why Markdown

Mission Passports carry strict, signed claims. Most local users are not
trying to author JWTs. The Markdown profile is a small, forgiving format
that compiles deterministically into a Mission Passport at
`ardur protect claude-code` time.

## Minimal Example

```markdown
# Ardur Guardrails
Mode: read only
Mission: Review this project without changing files or running commands.
Protect folder: .
Max tool calls: 100
Duration: 1d

## Allow
- Read files
- Search files

## Block
- Run shell commands
- Edit files
- Write files
```

## Top-Level Keys

Each appears as a `Key: value` line at the top of the file. Keys are
case-insensitive and may contain spaces. Multiple aliases are accepted for
the same key.

| Key | Aliases | Compiles to | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Mode` | — | `mode` | Free-form label, e.g. `read only`, `safe coding` |
| `Mission` | — | `mission` | The mission text the agent is bound to |
| `Protect folder` | `Scope`, `Folder` | `scope` | Path the agent is allowed to operate inside |
| `Max tool calls` | — | `max_tool_calls` | Integer |
| `Duration` | `Duration seconds`, `Max duration seconds` | `max_duration_s` | Accepts `30s`, `5m`, `2h`, `1d`, or a bare integer (seconds) |
| `Allowed tools` | `Allow tools` | `allowed_tools` | Comma- or semicolon-separated tool names. Adds to the `## Allow` section |
| `Forbidden tools` | `Blocked tools`, `Block tools` | `forbidden_tools` | Comma- or semicolon-separated tool names |

## Sections

Sections start with a Markdown heading (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.). The heading
text is normalised (lowercased, whitespace collapsed) and matched
case-insensitively. Bulleted list items (`-` or `*`) within a section
contribute to the corresponding allow/block list.

| Heading | Aliases | Adds entries to |
|---|---|---|
| `## Allow` | `Allowed`, `What AI can do`, `What the AI can do` | `allowed_tools` |
| `## Block` | `Blocked`, `What AI cannot do`, `What the AI cannot do` | `forbidden_tools` |
| `## Allowed tools` | `Advanced allowed tools` | `allowed_tools` (raw, no alias expansion) |
| `## Forbidden tools` | `Blocked tools`, `Advanced forbidden tools` | `forbidden_tools` (raw) |

Lines outside known sections are ignored. HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`) are
ignored.

## Friendly Tool Aliases

Items inside the `## Allow` and `## Block` sections are expanded through a
small alias table so non-technical users can write what they mean:

| Friendly phrase | Expands to |
|---|---|
| `Read files`, `Read` | `Read` |
| `Search files`, `Search` | `Glob`, `Grep` |
| `Edit files`, `Edit` | `Edit`, `MultiEdit` |
| `Write files`, `Write` | `Write` |
| `Run shell commands`, `Shell commands`, `Run commands`, `Bash` | `Bash` |

Items that don't match an alias pass through verbatim — so an advanced user
can still write `- WebFetch` and have it land as a Claude Code tool name in
the compiled Mission Passport.

The `## Allowed tools` and `## Forbidden tools` sections **do not** apply
alias expansion. Use them when you want exact tool names.

## Compilation Rules

`load_ardur_profile()` returns an `ArdurProfile` with these effective
values, which `ardur protect claude-code` then folds into the Mission
Passport:

- `mode`, `mission`, `scope`: trimmed strings, or `None` if absent.
- `allowed_tools`: deduped union of (alias-expanded `## Allow` items) ∪
  (`Allowed tools` key value) ∪ (`## Allowed tools` section items).
- `forbidden_tools`: same union for the block side.
- `max_tool_calls`: integer or `None`.
- `max_duration_s`: integer seconds. `30s`/`5m`/`2h`/`1d` shorthand is
  decoded against multipliers `{s:1, m:60, h:3600, d:86400}`.

## Built-In Templates

`ardur profile init --template TEMPLATE` writes one of:

- `read-only` — allow Read + Search; block shell, edit, write. Default for
  new users.
- `safe-coding` — allow Read, Search, Edit, Write inside the protected
  folder; block shell commands.

Template source is in
[`python/vibap/ardur_profile.py`](../../python/vibap/ardur_profile.py)
under `PROFILE_TEMPLATES`.

## Where the Compiled Passport Lives

After `ardur protect claude-code --profile ARDUR.md`:

- The compiled Mission Passport is written to `<home>/active_mission.jwt`.
- The Claude Code plugin reads `VIBAP_HOME` from the launch environment to
  find the active passport.
- Receipts land under `$ARDUR_CC_HOOK_DIR/<trace_id>/receipts.jsonl` (default
  `~/.vibap/claude-code-hook/<trace_id>/receipts.jsonl`).

See [`../guides/ardur-personal-hub.md`](../guides/ardur-personal-hub.md) for
the end-to-end walkthrough and
[`../../plugins/claude-code/README.md`](../../plugins/claude-code/README.md)
for receipt verification.
