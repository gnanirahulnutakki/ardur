# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs document load-bearing design decisions behind Ardur's runtime, protocol, and deployment shape. Each record captures the context, the decision, and the trade-offs known at the time of writing.

ADRs are migrated from the private research repo with the two-pass cleanup applied (sensitive-reference scrub, then historical-codename rename). Decision dates reflect when the decision was originally made; the migration preserves chronology even though the public repo is newer.

## Conventions

- **Status**: `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Superseded by ADR-NNN`, `Deprecated`. A `Proposed` status means the design is documented but not yet landed in code; it can still change.
- **Numbering**: sequential, no gaps. The formal ADR-file practice began at ADR-015 in the private research repo; earlier design decisions were captured in running decision logs rather than individual ADR files. Public numbering preserves the original sequence so cross-references stay stable.
- **Scope**: ADRs record decisions about the protocol (MCEP), the runtime (Ardur), and deployment shapes. They do not duplicate spec content — the v0.1 specs live in [`docs/specs/`](../specs/).
