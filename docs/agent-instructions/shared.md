# Shared Agent Contract

These rules apply to every agent runtime: Conductor, Codex, Claude, and any
future automation.

## Startup

1. Run `./scripts/conductor-bootstrap.sh`.
2. Read `.context/ARDUR_CONTEXT.md`.
3. Read `.context/ardur-graph.md`.
4. Use `.context/ardur-graph.json` as the structural map, then verify exact
   behavior with source files and tests.

If bootstrap fails, stop and fix or report the bootstrap problem before making
task-specific edits.

## Branch Flow

- `dev` is the integration branch.
- `origin/dev` is the default diff and PR base for normal development.
- `main` is release-only.
- Promote to `main` only after work has landed on `dev`, passed verification,
  and is ready as public-facing open source.
- If a workspace starts from `origin/main`, do not rename the branch. Still
  target the eventual PR/merge at `dev` unless the task is explicitly a release
  promotion.

## Repo Truth

Use current repo state over stale notes:

1. `git status`, branch refs, and live files.
2. `.github/workflows/`.
3. `AGENTS.md`, `docs/engineering-standards.md`, `docs/TESTING.md`,
   `docs/public-import-plan.md`, and `docs/decisions/`.
4. Generated `.context/` files, after checking their timestamp.

When sources conflict, state the conflict and verify from the current tree.

## Work Rules

- Preserve user work in progress.
- Do not reset, clean, revert, or switch branches destructively unless the user
  explicitly asks.
- Keep changes small, reviewable, and tied to the request.
- Keep public claims evidence-backed: test, command, artifact, verifier path, or
  explicit limitation.
- Do not add secrets, machine-local private paths, generated credentials, or
  local session state.
- Update docs when behavior or workflow changes.

## Validation

For small docs/script changes:

```bash
./scripts/check-local.sh --quick
```

For runtime changes after local setup:

```bash
./scripts/setup-dev.sh
./scripts/check-local.sh --full
```

If local Go is below `go/go.mod`, report the mismatch and do not claim full Go
validation.

## Local-Only Information

Local skills, session notes, scratch plans, and private agent state must stay in
ignored paths:

- `.context/skills/`
- `.agents/`
- `.local-skills/`
- `.ai-context/`
- `.agent-context/`
- `.codex/`
- `.claude/`
- `HANDOFF.md`
- `workdone-so-far.md`

Run `./scripts/check-local.sh --quick` before publishing to verify none of
those paths are tracked.
