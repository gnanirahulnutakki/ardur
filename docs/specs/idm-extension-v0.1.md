# IDM Extension Profile v0.1

> **Public-import note.** This document was authored against the private research repo's `docs/spec/` layout. In the public ardur tree, migrated specs live under `docs/specs/`. Any `docs/spec/...` path reference in the body refers to the original private layout; the public-tree mapping is in [`docs/specs/README.md`](./README.md).

## 1. Scope

This document defines the **Pre-Execution Intent Declaration Message (IDM)**
extension profile for the Ardur runtime-governance protocol.

IDM is an **optional extension** above the **MIC-Evidence** conformance profile.
It specifies a signed, pre-execution forecast of intended tool invocations that
enables a verifier to detect **plan-vs-execution drift** after a delegated
subtask completes.

IDM is **not required for base conformance**. A deployment that does not
implement IDM remains conformant so long as it satisfies the requirements of its
advertised base profile (Delegation-Core, MIC-State, or MIC-Evidence).

This document uses the key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**,
**SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY** as described in BCP 14 (RFC 2119 / RFC 8174).

## 2. Relationship to MIC-Evidence and the Opacity Reframe

The Silence Theorem (see Workstream C.1 / `docs/paper/sections-3-4-formal-model-theorem.md`)
establishes that Mission-Intent Compliance (MIC) is a hyperproperty over
projected traces, and that projection-induced information loss makes sound and
complete monitoring impossible in the general case. The tri-state verifier
operationalizes this limit: when the observable projection lacks information
required for a compliance verdict, the only honest result is
`insufficient_evidence`.

IDM does **not** eliminate this impossibility. It is a **gray-box augmentation**
of the projection: by declaring intent *before* execution, the agent supplies
additional semantic signal that the verifier can compare against the observed
step sequence. Where the declared plan and the observed trace diverge, the
verifier gains evidence of a violation that a purely scope-only projection might
miss. Where the agent accurately follows its declared intent, the verifier gains
confidence that the trace is consistent with the mission.

IDM is therefore a **measurable experiment**, not a protocol requirement. Its
value is empirical: it improves detection of certain semantic-drift violations
at the cost of requiring agents to forecast intent and verifiers to store and
compare plans.

## 3. Intent Message Format

An IDM is a JWS-signed JWT. It MUST be emitted **before** the first step of the
delegated subtask it describes. It MUST be signed by the **leaf delegation key**
bound to the active grant (`cnf.jwk` in AAT terminology).

### 3.1 Required Claims

| Claim | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `iss` | string | Identity of the agent or sub-agent issuing the intent. |
| `sub` | string | Same semantics as AAT `sub`; the subject principal. |
| `iat` | NumericDate | Time at which the intent was issued. |
| `exp` | NumericDate | Time after which the intent MUST NOT be accepted for drift comparison. SHOULD be ≤ the governing grant expiration. |
| `jti` | string | Unique intent identifier. |
| `grant_id` | string | The AAT `jti` of the delegation grant that authorizes this subtask. |
| `forecast_steps` | array | Ordered sequence of planned steps (see §3.3). |

### 3.2 Optional Claims

| Claim | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `forecast_duration_s` | number | Estimated wall-clock duration of the subtask, in seconds. |
| `forecast_budget_consumption` | object | Per-effect-class predicted consumption (see §3.4). |
| `parent_intent_id` | string or `null` | If this intent refines a broader parent intent, the parent `jti`. Otherwise `null`. |

### 3.3 `forecast_steps` Element

Each element in `forecast_steps` is an object with the following REQUIRED
members:

| Member | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `tool` | string | Tool, API, or capability the agent intends to invoke. |
| `action_class` | enum | High-level action family: `search`, `read`, `write`, `query`, `delegate`, `send`, `summarize`, or `observe`. |
| `target` | string | Normalized target of the intended invocation after projection. |
| `expected_effect_class` | enum | Predicted side-effect family: `none`, `internal_write`, `external_send`, or `state_change`. |

The order of elements in `forecast_steps` is **semantically significant**.
Reordering constitutes a drift signal unless the verifier policy explicitly
treats the steps as order-independent.

### 3.4 `forecast_budget_consumption`

When present, this claim MUST be an object whose keys are `side_effect_class`
values and whose values are non-negative integers representing the predicted
number of invocations in each effect class.

The sum of predicted values need not equal the length of `forecast_steps` if
the agent is uncertain about effect classification, but a verifier MAY flag a
large mismatch as a low-confidence intent.

### 3.5 Signature Requirements

- The IDM JWT MUST be signed with the private key corresponding to the leaf
  AAT's `cnf.jwk`.
- The protected header MUST set `alg` to `ES256`.
- The protected header SHOULD set `typ` to `application/ardur.idm+jwt`.
- Verifiers MUST reject an IDM whose signature does not verify against the
  `cnf.jwk` of the active grant identified by `grant_id`.

## 4. Verifier Delta Comparison

After the subtask completes (or after every evaluated step, at verifier
option), the verifier computes a **drift delta** between the IDM forecast and
the observed execution trace.

### 4.1 Inputs

1. The IDM JWT (validated and signature-verified).
2. The ordered sequence of Execution Receipts (ERs) emitted for the subtask.
3. The governing MD and DG.
4. Local thresholds configured by the deployment.

### 4.2 Drift Metrics

The verifier MUST compute at least the following four metrics:

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Step-count delta** | `\|actual_steps\| - \|forecast_steps\|` |
| **Ordering delta** | Levenshtein (or longest-common-subsequence) distance between the ordered `tool`+`action_class` sequences of the forecast and the actual trace. |
| **Per-step scope equality** | For each observed step, whether `{tool, action_class, target}` is element-wise equal to the corresponding forecast step. Steps beyond the forecast length are treated as out-of-scope additions. |
| **Budget delta** | Per-effect-class difference: `actual_consumed - forecast_budget_consumption[class]`. |

### 4.3 Threshold and Verdict

A verifier MAY apply deployment-specific thresholds to each metric. If **any**
metric exceeds its threshold, the verifier MUST emit a `violation` verdict with
denial reason `plan_execution_drift`.

If the trace is shorter than the forecast (negative step-count delta), the
verifier MUST treat the missing steps as a drift signal unless the MD policy
explicitly permits early termination.

If no IDM was emitted for a subtask and the deployment advertises the IDM
extension profile, the verifier MUST return `insufficient_evidence` for that
subtask, because the projection expected by the profile is incomplete.

### 4.4 Receipt Annotation

When an IDM is present and evaluated, the verifier SHOULD include the following
optional claims in the ER for the final step of the subtask:

- `idm_intent_id`: the IDM `jti`
- `idm_drift_score`: an aggregated drift score (0.0 = perfect match, 1.0 =
  maximal drift) computed from the metrics in §4.2
- `idm_verdict`: `matched` or `drift_detected`

These annotations are evidence-level metadata; they do not replace the tri-state
`verdict` of the ER itself.

## 5. Composition with MIC-Evidence

A deployment MUST satisfy **all** requirements of the MIC-Evidence profile
before it can advertise the IDM extension.

The conformance profile matrix (see Workstream A.5,
`docs/spec/conformance-profiles-v0.1.md`) lists the IDM extension separately:

| Profile | Position |
|---|---|
| Delegation-Core | Base |
| MIC-State | Base |
| MIC-Evidence | Base |
| IDM | **Extension above MIC-Evidence** |

An implementation MUST NOT claim IDM conformance unless it also passes the full
MIC-Evidence test vectors. IDM does not relax any MIC-Evidence requirement, nor
does it substitute for hidden-hop detection, budget conservation, or typed
projection honesty.

## 6. Empirical Evaluation Hook (E.7)

IDM's status as an extension is provisional on measurable empirical payoff. The
protocol maintainers will evaluate IDM against a controlled drift-detection
benchmark (Workstream E.7).

### 6.1 Benchmark Design

- **Arm A**: MIC-Evidence profile alone.
- **Arm B**: MIC-Evidence profile + IDM extension.
- **Task**: 50 agent sessions with mission drift injected at random steps.
- **Metric**: Detection rate of drift-injected sessions (true positives) and
  false-positive rate on clean sessions.

### 6.2 Decision Criterion

| Condition | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Δ ≥ 10 percentage points in detection rate (Arm B vs Arm A), with no significant increase in false positives | **Promote** IDM to a core profile or merge into a future revision of MIC-Evidence. |
| 0 ≤ Δ < 10 percentage points | **Keep as extension**. The primitive has value but does not justify base-requirement status. |
| Δ < 0 percentage points (IDM harms detection) | **Kill** the extension. Remove the spec in a future revision. |

This criterion is load-bearing. The spec will be honestly revisited after the
benchmark completes, regardless of whether the result favors the extension.

## 7. Security Considerations

### 7.1 IDM Is Not a Panacea

An attacker that controls the leaf agent can forge a malicious intent message
that matches the attack trace perfectly, causing the verifier to see zero drift.
IDM is therefore **not an integrity control**; it is a **plan-binding signal**
that helps honest agents demonstrate compliance and helps verifiers detect
*unintentional* or *opportunistic* drift. It does not stop an actively malicious
agent from lying about its intent.

### 7.2 Projection Augmentation, Not Replacement

Even with perfect intent forecasting, the verifier still observes only the
projected trace. IDM augments the information available to the monitor but does
not remove the fundamental limits formalized by the Silence Theorem. Verifiers
MUST continue to emit `insufficient_evidence` when the projection (including the
IDM) does not provide enough information for a compliance verdict.

### 7.3 Storage and Replay

IDMs are pre-execution artifacts. Verifiers MUST retain them for at least as
long as the corresponding subtask ERs are retained, because drift comparison
happens after execution. The IDM JWT MUST be integrity-protected before storage
and MUST be bound to the same `grant_id` at replay time to prevent
intent-laundering across grants.

## 8. Privacy Considerations

Intent declarations may reveal mission strategy or internal reasoning. Deployers
SHOULD apply the same confidentiality controls to stored IDMs as they apply to
MDs and ERs. IDMs SHOULD NOT be sent to untrusted third parties unless the
contained forecast steps are already public.

## 9. IANA Considerations

This document makes no IANA registration requests. If IDM is promoted to a core
profile in a future revision, the `application/ardur.idm+jwt` media type
SHOULD be registered.
