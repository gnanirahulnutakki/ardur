# MCEP Conformance Profiles v0.1

## Status

This document defines version `v0.1` of the conformance profile matrix for
the MCEP (Mission-Controlled Execution Protocol) runtime-governance protocol.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
and RFC 8174 when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.

## 1. Introduction

MCEP defines a layered conformance model so that vendors and deployments claim
specific capabilities rather than a monolithic "compliant / not-compliant"
binary. Each profile is a strict superset of the one below it.

This document is the authoritative, independently linkable reference for the
conformance matrix. It extracts and formalizes the embedded conformance
language from:

- A.1 / Mission Declaration (`docs/spec/mission-declaration-v0.1.md` §8.16,
  §10.3, Appendix A.4)
- A.3 / Execution Receipt (`docs/spec/execution-receipt-v0.1.md` §5)
- A.4 / Verifier Contract (`docs/spec/verifier-contract-v0.1.md` §6.2, §9)

## 2. Profile Hierarchy

The MCEP v0.1 conformance model defines three profiles and one optional
extension, ordered from weakest to strongest:

```text
Delegation-Core  ⊂  MIC-State  ⊂  MIC-Evidence  (+IDM extension)
```

A deployment claiming profile level N MUST satisfy all requirements of every
profile below N.

The `conformance_profile` claim in the MD (A.1 §8.16) MUST be set to one of:

1. `Delegation-Core`
2. `MIC-State`
3. `MIC-Evidence`

The IDM extension (A.7) is not a standalone profile value. It is an optional
capability layer on top of `MIC-Evidence`.

## 3. Profile Definitions

### 3.1. Delegation-Core

**Purpose**: Minimum viable delegation governance — signed policy envelope,
capability attenuation, cascading revocation, and basic receipt emission.

**Requirements**:

1. The verifier MUST validate the MD signature (A.1 §5).
2. The verifier MUST validate the DG chain per AAT §7 and the DG profile
   (A.2 §4).
3. The verifier MUST resolve `mission_ref` and verify mission binding
   (A.2 §3.3).
4. The verifier MUST evaluate `delegation_policy` attenuation rules
   (A.1 §8.12).
5. The verifier MUST check revocation status via `revocation_ref`
   (A.1 §8.18; A.6 §3).
6. The verifier MUST apply cascading revocation to descendant grants
   (A.6 §4).
7. The verifier MUST emit a linked Execution Receipt (A.3) for every
   evaluated step. Receipt `parent_receipt_id` MUST chain correctly.
8. The verifier MUST use the tri-state verdict codomain: `compliant`,
   `violation`, `insufficient_evidence` (A.4 §4).

### 3.2. MIC-State

**Purpose**: Stateful lineage-budget accounting and typed-projection
enforcement on top of Delegation-Core.

**Requirements** (in addition to all Delegation-Core requirements):

1. The verifier MUST maintain per-lineage `LineageState` keyed by
   `root_mission_id` (A.4 §5).
2. The verifier MUST initialize budget ceilings from
   `MD.lineage_budgets.per_effect_class` (A.4 §5.5).
3. The verifier MUST track `consumed_budget` and `reserved_budget` per
   effect class (`read`, `write`, `network`, `exec`, `external_send`)
   (A.4 §5.4).
4. The verifier MUST enforce budget conservation: cumulative consumption
   MUST NOT exceed the MD ceiling for any effect class (A.4 §9.4).
5. The verifier MUST enforce sibling-budget conservation in lineage state. It
   MAY use `reserved_budget_share` as an audit serialization, but MUST NOT make
   conservation depend on that claim being present (A.2 §6.3).
6. The verifier MUST enforce `required_telemetry` field presence: if any
   field named in `MD.required_telemetry` is missing or malformed, the
   verifier MUST return `insufficient_evidence` (A.4 §6.1).
7. The verifier MUST verify `observed_manifest_digest` against
   `MD.tool_manifest_digest` (A.4 §9.6).
8. The verifier MUST verify envelope signature validity (A.4 §9.5).
9. The verifier MUST normalize observed side-effect classes into the MD
   budget-bucket namespace deterministically (A.4 §6.5).
10. Child DG reservations MUST be recorded in verifier/application lineage
    state. Child DGs MAY carry `reserved_budget_share` for audit replay
    (A.2 §6.2).

### 3.3. MIC-Evidence

**Purpose**: Receipt completeness sufficient to fail closed on missing or
hidden evidence, on top of MIC-State.

**Requirements** (in addition to all MIC-State requirements):

1. The verifier MUST detect hidden hops: if a child action cannot be linked
   to its parent edge in the delegation graph, the verifier MUST return
   `insufficient_evidence` (A.4 §9.1).
2. The verifier MUST track `last_seen_receipts` per grant and detect
   missing linked receipts (A.4 §5.7).
3. Every delegation edge MUST produce a downstream ER visible to the
   verifier. Missing downstream receipts MUST trigger
   `insufficient_evidence`.
4. `receipt_policy.level` MUST NOT be `minimal` (A.1 §8.16).
5. The verifier MUST track `delegation_graph` and maintain a DAG over
   observed grants (A.4 §5.3).
6. If `ObservedEvent.visibility` is not `full`, the verifier MUST return
   `insufficient_evidence`.

## 4. Required Telemetry per Profile

The following table lists the `ObservedEvent` fields (A.4 §6.2) required at
each profile level. A field marked "REQUIRED" MUST be present and well-typed
for the verifier to return `compliant`. A field marked "—" is not required
by that profile but MAY be present.

| Field | Delegation-Core | MIC-State | MIC-Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `event_id` | REQUIRED | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `session_id` | REQUIRED | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `timestamp` | REQUIRED | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `actor` | REQUIRED | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `grant_id` | REQUIRED | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `tool_name` | REQUIRED | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `action_class` | REQUIRED | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `target` | REQUIRED | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `resource_family` | REQUIRED | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `side_effect_class` | REQUIRED | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `budget_delta` | — | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `visibility` | — | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `parent_event_id` | — | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `delegation_from` | — | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `delegation_to` | — | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `content_class` | — | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `content_provenance` | — | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `sensitivity` | — | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `instruction_bearing` | — | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `summary` | — | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `confidence_hint` | — | RECOMMENDED | RECOMMENDED |
| `envelope_signature_valid` | — | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `observed_manifest_digest` | — | REQUIRED | REQUIRED |
| `parent_receipt_id` | — | — | REQUIRED |
| `downstream_receipt_ids` | — | — | REQUIRED |

For the IDM extension, the following additional ER annotations are REQUIRED:

| ER Annotation | IDM Extension |
|---|---|
| `idm_intent_id` | REQUIRED |
| `idm_drift_score` | REQUIRED |
| `idm_verdict` | REQUIRED |

## 5. Operational Modes per Profile

Each profile supports both `enforce` and `attest` modes (A.4 §7). The mode
affects gating behavior, not verdict calculation.

| Profile | `enforce` | `attest` |
|---|---|---|
| Delegation-Core | Block on `violation`. Permit on `compliant`. `insufficient_evidence` follows deployment-local `insufficient_evidence_policy`. | Always permit. Emit ER with actual verdict. |
| MIC-State | Same as Delegation-Core, plus budget-overspend and manifest-drift violations are blocking. | Same as Delegation-Core, plus budget and manifest verdicts are recorded. |
| MIC-Evidence | Same as MIC-State, plus hidden-hop and missing-receipt trigger `insufficient_evidence` which follows `insufficient_evidence_policy`. | Same as MIC-State, plus evidence gaps are recorded. |
| IDM extension | Same as MIC-Evidence, plus `plan_execution_drift` violations are blocking. | Same as MIC-Evidence, plus drift verdicts are recorded. |

In `enforce` mode, the `insufficient_evidence_policy` binding MUST be
documented explicitly by the deployment (A.4 §7.2).

## 6. Fail-Closed Rule Summary

The following table collects the normative fail-closed rules from A.4 §9
and maps them to the minimum profile at which each rule applies:

| Condition | Verdict | Public denial reason | Audit-only internal code | Minimum profile |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hidden hop detected | `insufficient_evidence` | `insufficient_evidence` | `telemetry_missing` | MIC-Evidence |
| Missing required telemetry | `insufficient_evidence` | `insufficient_evidence` | `telemetry_missing` | MIC-State |
| Cascading revocation | `violation` | `revoked` | `revoked` | Delegation-Core |
| Budget over-reserve or overspend | `violation` | `budget_exhausted` | `budget_exhausted` | MIC-State |
| Envelope signature invalid | `violation` | `policy_denied` | `envelope_tampered` | MIC-State |
| Manifest digest mismatch | `violation` | `policy_denied` | `manifest_drift` | MIC-State |
| DG chain invalid | `violation` | `chain_invalid` | `chain_invalid` | Delegation-Core |
| Memory integrity failure | `violation` | `policy_denied` | `memory_integrity_failure` | MIC-State |
| Probing rate exceeded | `violation` | `policy_denied` | `probing_rate_exceeded` | MIC-State |
| Approval fatigue threshold | `violation` | `policy_denied` | `approval_fatigue_threshold` | MIC-State |
| Plan-execution drift | `violation` | `policy_denied` | `plan_execution_drift` | IDM extension |

## 7. Conformance Test Vector Index

Test vectors are stored in `docs/spec/conformance/` using the JSONL format
described in `docs/spec/conformance/README.md`.

Each test vector specifies:

1. `profile` — the conformance profile under test;
2. `test_id` — stable identifier;
3. `description` — human-readable description;
4. `inputs` — MD, DG, ObservedEvent, and LineageState fragments;
5. `expected_verdict` — one of `compliant`, `violation`,
   `insufficient_evidence`; and
6. `expected_public_denial_reason` — when verdict is not `compliant`.

### 7.1. Delegation-Core Vectors

| Test ID | Description | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| `DC-01` | Valid delegation chain, all Delegation-Core fields present | `compliant` |
| `DC-02` | MD signature invalid | `violation` / `policy_denied` |
| `DC-03` | DG `mission_ref` missing | `violation` / `chain_invalid` |
| `DC-04` | DG `mission_ref` differs from parent | `violation` / `chain_invalid` |
| `DC-05` | MD revoked via Token Status List | `violation` / `revoked` |
| `DC-06` | Ancestor grant revoked, cascading to descendant | `violation` / `revoked` |
| `DC-07` | Receipt `parent_receipt_id` chain broken | `insufficient_evidence` / `insufficient_evidence` |

### 7.2. MIC-State Vectors

| Test ID | Description | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| `MS-01` | Budget consumption within ceiling | `compliant` |
| `MS-02` | Budget consumption exceeds ceiling | `violation` / `budget_exhausted` |
| `MS-03` | Sibling over-reserve exceeds parent share | `violation` / `budget_exhausted` |
| `MS-04` | Required telemetry field missing | `insufficient_evidence` / `insufficient_evidence` |
| `MS-05` | Manifest digest mismatch | `violation` / `policy_denied` |
| `MS-06` | Envelope signature invalid | `violation` / `policy_denied` |
| `MS-07` | Side-effect class normalization ambiguity | `insufficient_evidence` / `insufficient_evidence` |

### 7.3. MIC-Evidence Vectors

| Test ID | Description | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| `ME-01` | Full evidence chain, all receipts linked | `compliant` |
| `ME-02` | Hidden hop: child action with no parent edge | `insufficient_evidence` / `insufficient_evidence` |
| `ME-03` | Missing downstream receipt after delegation | `insufficient_evidence` / `insufficient_evidence` |
| `ME-04` | Visibility = `partial` | `insufficient_evidence` / `insufficient_evidence` |
| `ME-05` | Visibility = `hidden` | `insufficient_evidence` / `insufficient_evidence` |

### 7.4. IDM Extension Vectors

| Test ID | Description | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| `IDM-01` | IDM present, no drift | `compliant` |
| `IDM-02` | IDM present, step-count drift exceeds threshold | `violation` / `policy_denied` |
| `IDM-03` | IDM present, ordering drift exceeds threshold | `violation` / `policy_denied` |
| `IDM-04` | IDM absent but MD advertises extension | `insufficient_evidence` / `insufficient_evidence` |

## 8. Security Considerations

### 8.1. Profile Downgrade

An attacker who can modify `MD.conformance_profile` can weaken the verifier's
evidence requirements. The MD signature (A.1 §5) is the primary defense.

Verifiers MUST verify the MD signature before reading `conformance_profile`.

### 8.2. Profile Mismatch Across Lineage

A child DG MUST NOT claim a weaker conformance profile than the mission root
(A.1 §8.12.3, rule `profile_nonweakening`). If a verifier observes a child
operating under a weaker profile than the MD declares, it MUST return
`violation` with `public_denial_reason = "chain_invalid"`.

### 8.3. Incomplete Evidence vs. Malice

`insufficient_evidence` is an honesty outcome. It does not prove malicious
intent. Deployments MUST NOT automatically escalate `insufficient_evidence`
to `violation` without additional forensic analysis.

### 8.4. Sandbox Isolation and Profile Relationship

Sandbox isolation (Appendix A) is a deployment-layer defense. It does not
substitute for protocol-layer conformance checks. A deployment that uses
gVisor but skips budget accounting MUST NOT claim MIC-State conformance.

## Appendix A. Deployment Guidance (Non-Normative)

This appendix provides non-normative guidance for container-isolation
strategies applicable to MCP-server and tool-plugin deployments.

### A.1. Isolation Recommendations

| Isolation Technology | Overhead | Threat Model | Recommended Profile |
|---|---|---|---|
| gVisor (runsc) | Low (~5–15% syscall overhead) | Kernel-attack surface reduction | MIC-State or higher |
| Kata Containers | Medium (~50–100 ms cold start) | Full VM-level isolation per container | MIC-Evidence |
| Firecracker microVM | Low (~125 ms cold start) | Lightweight VM with minimal device model | MIC-Evidence |
| Native container (runc) | Minimal | Namespace + cgroup isolation only | Delegation-Core |

### A.2. MCP Server Isolation

When deploying MCP servers as tool providers:

1. Each MCP server instance SHOULD run in its own isolation boundary.
2. The MCP server's tool manifest MUST be bound to the MD via
   `tool_manifest_digest` (A.1 §8.17).
3. Network egress from the MCP server SHOULD be restricted to the
   destinations permitted by `MD.resource_policies` and
   `MD.effect_policies`.
4. For MIC-Evidence deployments, the isolation boundary SHOULD provide
   kernel-level syscall observability (e.g., Tetragon, Falco) to support
   full visibility telemetry.

### A.3. Tool-Plugin Isolation

When deploying tool plugins within an agent runtime:

1. Each plugin SHOULD execute in a sandboxed subprocess or WASM module.
2. The plugin's resource access MUST be mediated by the agent runtime's
   policy engine.
3. For MIC-State or higher, the runtime MUST track per-plugin budget
   consumption and report it as part of the `ObservedEvent`.
