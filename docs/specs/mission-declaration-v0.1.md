# Mission Declaration (MD) v0.1

> **Public-import note.** This document was authored against the private research repo's `docs/spec/` layout. In the public ardur tree, migrated specs live under `docs/specs/`. Any `docs/spec/...` path reference in the body refers to the original private layout; the public-tree mapping is in [`docs/specs/README.md`](./README.md).
## Status
This document defines version `v0.1` of the Mission Declaration (MD)
claims-set format for the Ardur runtime-governance protocol.
This document is written in an RFC-style normative form.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
RFC 2119 and RFC 8174 when, and only when, they appear in all capitals.
## 1. Introduction
The Ardur runtime-governance protocol separates delegated authority,
mission policy, and execution evidence into three distinct artifacts:
1. Mission Declaration (MD)
2. Delegation Grant (DG)
3. Execution Receipt (ER)
The Mission Declaration is the issuer-signed, human-reviewable policy
envelope for a mission.
The Delegation Grant is carried by the Attenuating Authorization Token
(AAT) wire format.
The Execution Receipt is the per-hop signed evidence record emitted by
verifiers and, in stronger profiles, by execution environments.
The MD is intentionally responsible for semantics that AAT explicitly
does not carry, including:
1. cumulative lineage budgets
2. typed side-effect policy
3. mission-scoped delegation policy
4. required telemetry obligations
5. conformance profile selection
6. revocation pointer
7. approval-fatigue controls
8. governed memory-store policy
This document defines:
1. the MD JSON claims-set
2. required and optional members
3. issuer and verifier processing rules
4. hashing and canonicalization rules
5. the companion JSON Schema
This document does not define:
1. the `mission_ref` AAT profile claim
2. the Execution Receipt schema
3. the full Token Status List profile for mission revocation
4. the tool manifest schema
5. the full verifier state machine
Those topics are defined by companion documents.
## 2. Representation Model
An MD is represented as a JWT payload encoded as a JSON object.
The JSON object defined by this document is the authoritative data model.
The JOSE wrapper is transport and integrity metadata around that object.
The examples in `docs/spec/examples/*.json` are payload objects only.
The examples are not signed JWTs.
The JSON Schema in
`docs/spec/mission-declaration-v0.1.schema.json`
validates the payload object only.
An implementation that accepts a compact JWT serialization:
1. MUST verify the JOSE signature first
2. MUST decode the payload to a JSON object
3. MUST validate the decoded payload against this specification
4. MUST reject the token if the payload object violates this specification
An implementation that stores or exchanges detached payload objects:
1. MUST preserve the exact semantic content of the JSON object
2. MUST apply RFC 8785 canonicalization before any hashing step defined by
   this document
3. MUST bind the payload object to an ES256 signature before treating it as
   authoritative policy
## 3. Design Goals
The MD format has the following goals:
1. human reviewability
2. strict fail-closed parsing
3. offline verifier compatibility
4. composability with AAT
5. reuse of existing cryptographic primitives
6. deterministic hashing
7. unambiguous claim semantics
The MD format is intentionally conservative.
This version prioritizes deterministic parsing and predictable security
properties over extensibility.
Unknown top-level claims are therefore forbidden.
## 4. Relationship to DG and ER
The MD is mission-scoped.
The DG is delegation-hop-scoped.
The ER is execution-hop-scoped.
The following relationships apply:
1. Every DG that participates in this protocol profile MUST reference one
   MD by `mission_ref`.
2. Every ER emitted for a governed action MUST be attributable to exactly
   one DG and, through that DG, to exactly one MD.
3. A verifier MAY cache MDs offline.
4. A verifier that uses a cached MD MUST still validate the MD signature,
   temporal validity, and revocation status before use.
5. An MD MUST be usable by a verifier that has no online connectivity at
   evaluation time, provided the verifier has a cached MD, the issuer key,
   and a cached status list.
The MD is therefore a policy root for a mission.
It is not a running state ledger.
Live budget consumption, live descendant reservations, and live receipt
tracking belong to verifier state and DG / ER processing, not to the MD
payload itself.
## 5. Serialization and Signing
### 5.1. JWT Envelope
An MD MUST be signed as a JWT using JWS compact serialization.
The JWS `alg` header parameter MUST be `ES256`.
No other signing algorithm is permitted by this version.
The MD format defined by this document MUST NOT be signed with a symmetric
algorithm.
The MD format defined by this document MUST NOT be signed with `alg: "none"`.
An issuer MUST maintain an explicit algorithm allowlist.
A verifier MUST reject any MD whose JWS header uses an algorithm other than
`ES256`.
An issuer SHOULD set `typ` to `JWT`.
A verifier MUST NOT treat the absence of `typ` as a signature failure if
the signature and payload otherwise validate.
This document does not define encrypted MD payloads.
Deployments that store or transport MDs over untrusted channels SHOULD rely
on transport confidentiality in addition to JWS integrity protection.
### 5.2. JWT Claim-Set Scope
This document defines the MD payload object.
The JOSE header is out of scope except for the signing requirements in this
section.
All normative claim requirements in this document apply to the decoded JSON
payload.
### 5.3. NumericDate Claims
The `iat` and `exp` claims MUST be encoded as JWT NumericDate integer
values.
Fractional seconds MUST NOT be used.
An issuer MUST ensure:
1. `iat` is not in the future relative to the issuer clock
2. `exp` is strictly greater than `iat`
3. the mission validity interval is consistent with local policy
A verifier MUST reject an MD if:
1. `exp <= iat`
2. `exp` is in the past at verification time, subject to local clock-skew
   policy
3. `iat` cannot be parsed as an integer NumericDate
This document does not define `nbf`.
Issuers and verifiers operating under this version MUST NOT add `nbf` as an
unregistered top-level claim in the MD payload.
### 5.4. Fail-Closed Unknown Fields
The MD payload has a closed top-level schema.
An issuer MUST reject any payload object that contains a top-level member
not defined by this specification.
This requirement is normative and fail-closed.
A verifier MUST reject any MD payload that contains a top-level member not
defined by this specification.
This requirement intentionally mirrors the current fail-closed constructor
behavior in `vibap-prototype/vibap/passport.py`.
Forward-compatible extension in this protocol family MUST occur through a
new versioned schema, not through silent acceptance of unknown top-level
members.
### 5.5. Nested Objects
Every nested object defined by this specification is also closed.
An issuer MUST reject any nested object that contains a member not defined
for that object.
A verifier MUST reject any nested object that contains a member not defined
for that object.
### 5.6. Arrays and Ordering
Array element order is not semantically significant unless this document
states otherwise.
Implementations MUST NOT assign semantic meaning to array order for:
1. `allowed_tool_classes`
2. `resource_policies`
3. `effect_policies`
4. `allowed_child_subjects`
5. `attenuation_rules`
6. `flow_policies`
7. `required_telemetry`
8. `governed_memory_stores`
Implementations MAY preserve source order for display.
Hashing defined by this document operates on RFC 8785 canonicalized JSON,
not on source formatting or source property order.
## 6. Canonicalization and Hashing
### 6.1. General Rule
Any hashing step defined by this document MUST be applied to the RFC 8785
JCS canonical form of the relevant JSON value.
The canonicalized bytes MUST be UTF-8 encoded before hashing.
### 6.2. JCS Preconditions
Before canonicalization, the producer and consumer MUST parse the JSON
value as JSON data, not as a raw byte string.
The parsed JSON value MUST satisfy the I-JSON constraints required by
RFC 8785.
If canonicalization fails, the operation in progress MUST fail.
### 6.3. Hash Algorithm
All hashes defined by this document use SHA-256.
This version introduces no new cryptographic primitive beyond:
1. ES256 signatures
2. SHA-256 hashing
### 6.4. Digest String Encoding
Unless another companion specification says otherwise, a SHA-256 digest
carried as an MD claim MUST be encoded as:
`sha-256:` followed by exactly 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters.
Uppercase hexadecimal characters MUST NOT be used.
Base64url encoding MUST NOT be used for MD digest claims defined by this
version.
### 6.5. Example Hash Procedure
To compute a digest under this document:
1. parse the relevant JSON value
2. verify that it is valid JSON for the intended object type
3. canonicalize it with RFC 8785
4. UTF-8 encode the canonical result
5. compute SHA-256 over those bytes
6. encode the result as `sha-256:` plus lowercase hex
## 7. Core Data Model
### 7.1. Top-Level Claims
An MD payload object in version `v0.1` contains the following top-level
claims:
1. `iss`
2. `sub`
3. `aud`
4. `iat`
5. `exp`
6. `jti`
7. `mission_id`
8. `allowed_tool_classes`
9. `resource_policies`
10. `effect_policies`
11. `lineage_budgets`
12. `delegation_policy`
13. `flow_policies`
14. `required_telemetry`
15. `receipt_policy`
16. `conformance_profile`

19. `approval_policy`
20. `governed_memory_stores`
21. `probing_rate_limit`
22. `idm_extension` (OPTIONAL)
All claims other than `idm_extension` are REQUIRED.
An MD without every required claim is invalid.
### 7.2. Common Claim Rules
Every string claim defined by this document:
1. MUST be encoded as a JSON string
2. MUST NOT be the empty string
3. MUST NOT be whitespace-only
Every integer claim defined by this document:
1. MUST be encoded as a JSON number with integer value
2. MUST be greater than or equal to zero unless a stricter bound is given
Every array claim defined by this document:
1. MUST be encoded as a JSON array
2. MUST contain only elements of the defined type
3. MUST NOT contain `null`
Every object claim defined by this document:
1. MUST be encoded as a JSON object
2. MUST conform to the closed member set defined for that object
## 8. Claim Definitions
### 8.1. `iss`
The `iss` claim identifies the MD issuer.
`iss` MUST be present.
`iss` MUST be a non-empty string.
`iss` SHOULD be a stable issuer identifier.
`iss` SHOULD be an HTTPS URI or another StringOrURI value that is stable
within the deployment.
If the issuer rotates signing keys, the `iss` value SHOULD remain stable.
The issuer key lookup procedure is out of scope for this document.
### 8.2. `sub`
The `sub` claim identifies the primary mission subject.
`sub` MUST be present.
`sub` MUST be a non-empty string.
`sub` MAY identify:
1. a single root agent
2. an agent workload class
3. a service principal
4. a user-delegated agent identity
The exact identity namespace is deployment-specific.
The value carried in `sub` SHOULD be compatible with the subject namespace
used by DGs and ObservedEvents in the same deployment.
### 8.3. `aud`
The `aud` claim identifies the intended verifier audience.
`aud` MUST be present.
`aud` MUST be a non-empty string in this version.
This version does not permit the JSON-array form of JWT `aud`.
An issuer MUST mint MDs with a single audience string.
A verifier MUST compare the MD `aud` claim against its configured audience
identifier.
If the audience does not match, the verifier MUST reject the MD.
### 8.4. `iat`
The `iat` claim records the issuance time of the MD.
`iat` MUST be present.
`iat` MUST be a NumericDate integer.
The issuer clock used for `iat` SHOULD be synchronized.
### 8.5. `exp`
The `exp` claim records the expiration time of the MD.
`exp` MUST be present.
`exp` MUST be a NumericDate integer.
`exp` MUST be strictly greater than `iat`.
An issuer SHOULD prefer short validity windows when mission policy is
short-lived.
A verifier MUST reject an expired MD.
### 8.6. `jti`
The `jti` claim identifies the specific signed MD instance.
`jti` MUST be present.
`jti` MUST be globally unique within the issuer namespace for the lifetime
of the token and any relevant audit retention window.
`jti` SHOULD be a UUID or other collision-resistant identifier.
`jti` identifies the signed instance.
It is not the same thing as `mission_id`.
### 8.7. `mission_id`
The `mission_id` claim identifies the mission itself.
`mission_id` MUST be present.
`mission_id` MUST be a non-empty string.
`mission_id` SHOULD be a URI or URN.
`mission_id` SHOULD remain stable across re-signing or re-issuance of the
same mission policy.
If the issuer rotates an MD instance without changing the mission policy,
the issuer SHOULD mint a new `jti` and SHOULD preserve `mission_id`.
If the issuer changes mission semantics in a materially incompatible way,
the issuer SHOULD mint a new `mission_id`.
`mission_id` and `jti` SHOULD NOT be identical except in trivial
single-instance deployments.
### 8.8. `allowed_tool_classes`
The `allowed_tool_classes` claim enumerates the tool classes permitted by
the mission.
`allowed_tool_classes` MUST be present.
`allowed_tool_classes` MUST be an array of one or more strings.
Each element MUST be an absolute URI.
Each element SHOULD be authority-scoped in the sense of AAT Section 3.3.1.
Each element SHOULD use a URI authority corresponding to:
1. the workload identity of the tool provider, or
2. a domain controlled by the tool operator
Each element SHOULD include either:
1. a version component, or
2. a content-hash component
This requirement ensures that all parties reason about the same tool
schema.
Issuers MUST reject duplicate tool-class URIs.
Verifiers MUST treat tool-class URI comparison as exact string equality.
This version does not define URI normalization beyond ordinary JSON string
comparison.
Examples of valid tool-class URIs:
1. `https://billing-agent.example.com/tools/charge/v2`
2. `https://gitops.example.net/tools/apply@sha256-0f4c...`
### 8.9. `resource_policies`
The `resource_policies` claim enumerates governed resource families and
matching patterns.
`resource_policies` MUST be present.
`resource_policies` MUST be a non-empty array.
Each array member MUST be an object with exactly these members:
1. `family`
2. `pattern`
3. `sensitivity`
#### 8.9.1. `resource_policies[].family`
`family` identifies a resource namespace.
`family` MUST be a non-empty string.
Examples include:
1. `filesystem`
2. `http`
3. `database`
4. `email`
5. `artifact`
6. `memory`
This version does not create an IANA registry for resource families.
Deployments SHOULD use stable, documented family identifiers.
#### 8.9.2. `resource_policies[].pattern`
`pattern` identifies which resources in the family are governed by the
policy entry.
`pattern` MUST be a non-empty string.
`pattern` MUST use one of these two prefix forms:
1. `exact:`
2. `glob:`
If the prefix is `exact:`, the remainder of the string is matched by exact
string equality after any family-specific normalization defined by the
deployment.
If the prefix is `glob:`, the remainder of the string is matched with a
deterministic glob procedure.
For `glob:` patterns:
1. `*` matches zero or more characters
2. `?` matches exactly one character
3. `**` MAY cross separator boundaries
The separator notion is family-specific.
If a family does not define a separator, `*` and `**` are equivalent.
An issuer MUST reject any pattern that does not use the required prefix.
A verifier MUST reject any MD that carries a malformed resource pattern.
#### 8.9.3. `resource_policies[].sensitivity`
`sensitivity` is the issuer-defined sensitivity label associated with the
matching resource set.
`sensitivity` MUST be a non-empty string.
This version does not constrain the label vocabulary.
For interoperability, issuers SHOULD use a stable sensitivity taxonomy.
A deployment MAY use values such as:
1. `public`
2. `internal`
3. `confidential`
4. `restricted`
Verifiers MUST compare sensitivity labels by exact string equality.
#### 8.9.4. Overlap and Specificity
This version permits overlapping resource-policy entries.
Issuers SHOULD avoid ambiguous overlap.
If multiple resource-policy entries match the same observed resource, the
verifier SHOULD apply the most specific match.
If the verifier cannot determine specificity deterministically, the
verifier MUST fail closed.
### 8.10. `effect_policies`
The `effect_policies` claim constrains per-event budget deltas by
side-effect class.
`effect_policies` MUST be present.
`effect_policies` MUST contain exactly one entry for each side-effect class
defined by this version.
The defined side-effect classes are:
1. `read`
2. `write`
3. `network`
4. `exec`
5. `external_send`
Each array member MUST be an object with exactly these members:
1. `side_effect_class`
2. `limit`
`side_effect_class` MUST be one of the five values above.
`limit` MUST be a non-negative integer.
`limit` defines the maximum `budget_delta` a single observed action of that
side-effect class MAY consume.
This makes `effect_policies` a per-event guardrail.
The cumulative, lineage-wide ceiling is carried separately by
`lineage_budgets`.
If `limit` is `0`, the side-effect class is denied for event execution.
Issuers SHOULD keep `effect_policies` and `lineage_budgets` aligned.
For example, issuers SHOULD NOT assign a positive lineage ceiling to a
side-effect class whose per-event limit is zero unless the mission is being
pre-provisioned for later re-issuance.
### 8.11. `lineage_budgets`
The `lineage_budgets` claim defines mission-wide escrow-rights ceilings by
side-effect class.
`lineage_budgets` MUST be present.
`lineage_budgets` MUST be an object with exactly one member:
1. `per_effect_class`
`per_effect_class` MUST be an object with exactly these five members:
1. `read`
2. `write`
3. `network`
4. `exec`
5. `external_send`
Each side-effect-class member MUST be an object with exactly these members:
1. `reserved`
2. `ceiling`
`reserved` MUST be a non-negative integer.
`ceiling` MUST be a non-negative integer.
`reserved` MUST be less than or equal to `ceiling`.
`ceiling` is the mission-wide maximum cumulative spend permitted for that
side-effect class across the full delegation tree.
`reserved` is the amount already encumbered at MD issuance time.
`reserved` is not the live running spend total.
`reserved` is not the verifier's live descendant-reservation map.
For a newly issued root mission with no pre-existing descendants, issuers
SHOULD set `reserved` to `0` for every side-effect class.
If an issuer mints an MD for a mission that already has active descendant
allocations, the issuer MAY set a non-zero `reserved` value to encode the
encumbered starting state.
Verifiers MUST initialize live lineage state from `reserved` and `ceiling`.
Verifiers MUST reject any MD in which `reserved > ceiling` for any
side-effect class.
### 8.12. `delegation_policy`
The `delegation_policy` claim constrains how DGs may be minted under the
mission.
`delegation_policy` MUST be present.
`delegation_policy` MUST be an object with exactly these members:
1. `max_depth`
2. `allowed_child_subjects`
3. `attenuation_rules`
#### 8.12.1. `delegation_policy.max_depth`
`max_depth` MUST be a non-negative integer.
`max_depth = 0` means no child DG may be minted under the mission.
`max_depth = 1` means the root subject may mint direct children, but those
children may not mint grandchildren.
Issuers SHOULD set `max_depth` to the minimum value that supports the
intended workflow.
#### 8.12.2. `delegation_policy.allowed_child_subjects`
`allowed_child_subjects` MUST be an array.
Each element MUST be a non-empty string.
Each element MUST use one of these two prefix forms:
1. `exact:`
2. `glob:`
The match target is the child DG `sub` value.
If `max_depth > 0`, issuers SHOULD provide at least one matching rule.
If `allowed_child_subjects` is empty and `max_depth > 0`, the issuer is
declaring that delegation is structurally allowed but no child subjects are
currently authorized.
Verifiers MUST treat an empty `allowed_child_subjects` array as "match no
subjects".
#### 8.12.3. `delegation_policy.attenuation_rules`
`attenuation_rules` MUST be a non-empty array of rule identifiers.
This version defines these rule identifiers:
1. `tool_subset`
2. `resource_subset`
3. `effect_subset`
4. `budget_nonincrease`
5. `telemetry_nonweakening`
6. `receipt_level_nonweakening`
7. `profile_nonweakening`
8. `memory_store_subset`
Their semantics are:
1. `tool_subset`
   A child DG MUST authorize a subset of the parent's tool classes.
2. `resource_subset`
   A child DG MUST authorize a subset of the parent mission's resource
   patterns.
3. `effect_subset`
   A child DG MUST authorize a subset of the parent mission's effect
   classes.
4. `budget_nonincrease`
   A child DG MUST NOT increase any lineage ceiling or any active reserved
   share.
5. `telemetry_nonweakening`
   A child DG MUST NOT weaken telemetry obligations below the mission's
   required telemetry set.
6. `receipt_level_nonweakening`
   A child DG MUST NOT require a weaker receipt level than the mission.
7. `profile_nonweakening`
   A child DG MUST NOT claim a weaker conformance profile than the mission.
8. `memory_store_subset`
   A child DG MUST NOT introduce governed memory stores outside the mission
   set.
Issuers SHOULD include every rule identifier whose invariant they expect
downstream verifiers to enforce.
Verifiers MUST reject unknown attenuation-rule identifiers.
### 8.13. `flow_policies`
The `flow_policies` claim encodes IFC-compatible source-to-sink flow rules.
`flow_policies` MUST be present.
`flow_policies` MAY be an empty array.
Each array member MUST be an object with exactly these members:
1. `from_class`
2. `to_class`
3. `action`
`from_class` MUST be a non-empty string.
`to_class` MUST be a non-empty string.
`action` MUST be one of:
1. `allow`
2. `deny`
This version keeps flow-policy actions intentionally binary.
Deployments that require richer declassification workflows MUST version the
schema rather than overloading the `action` field.
Issuers SHOULD align flow classes with the deployment's content and
sensitivity taxonomies.
Verifiers MUST compare flow classes by exact string equality.
If multiple flow rules match the same transition and disagree, the verifier
MUST fail closed.
If no flow rule matches a transition, the verifier SHOULD apply local
default-deny behavior unless the conformance profile explicitly treats flow
policy as advisory.
### 8.14. `required_telemetry`
The `required_telemetry` claim enumerates the observation fields the
verifier MUST see for every governed action.
`required_telemetry` MUST be present.
`required_telemetry` MUST be a non-empty array.
Duplicate telemetry field identifiers are not permitted.
This version defines the following telemetry field identifiers:
1. `event_id`
2. `session_id`
3. `timestamp`
4. `actor`
5. `action_class`
6. `tool_name`
7. `target`
8. `resource_family`
9. `content_class`
10. `content_provenance`
11. `summary`
12. `side_effect_class`
13. `visibility`
14. `parent_event_id`
15. `delegation_from`
16. `delegation_to`
17. `confidence_hint`
18. `sensitivity`
19. `instruction_bearing`
20. `budget_delta`
21. `grant_id`
If a field named in `required_telemetry` is absent, null, empty when a
non-empty value is required, or structurally invalid in an observed action,
the verifier MUST return `insufficient_evidence`.
The verifier MUST NOT silently synthesize a default value for a missing
required telemetry field.
If `visibility` is listed in `required_telemetry` and the observation
indicates partial or missing visibility, the verifier SHOULD treat the
action as `insufficient_evidence` unless a stronger local evidence model can
prove that the missing data is irrelevant to the mission predicate.
### 8.15. `receipt_policy`
The `receipt_policy` claim defines the minimum evidence level the verifier
must require for governed actions.
`receipt_policy` MUST be present.
`receipt_policy` MUST be an object with exactly one member:
1. `level`
`level` MUST be one of:
1. `minimal`
2. `counter_signed`
3. `transparency_logged`
The levels are ordered from weakest to strongest.
Their semantics are:
1. `minimal`
   The verifier MUST emit an ER signed by the verifier or enforcement
   point.
2. `counter_signed`
   In addition to the verifier signature, the execution environment, tool
   adapter, or equivalent downstream component MUST counter-sign the ER or
   equivalent evidence record.
3. `transparency_logged`
   The ER MUST satisfy the `counter_signed` requirements and MUST be logged
   in an append-only transparency system with an inclusion reference that
   the verifier can check or cache.
A child artifact MUST NOT weaken the receipt level below the mission's
declared level.
### 8.16. `conformance_profile`
The `conformance_profile` claim identifies the minimum protocol profile the
deployment claims for the mission.
`conformance_profile` MUST be present.
`conformance_profile` MUST be one of:
1. `Delegation-Core`
2. `MIC-State`
3. `MIC-Evidence`
The profiles are ordered from weakest to strongest.
Their semantics are:
1. `Delegation-Core`
   Requires signed MD validation, DG linkage, delegation-policy evaluation,
   revocation checking, and basic receipt emission.
2. `MIC-State`
   Requires `Delegation-Core` plus stateful lineage-budget accounting and
   required-telemetry enforcement.
3. `MIC-Evidence`
   Requires `MIC-State` plus receipt completeness sufficient to fail closed
   when required evidence is missing.
If `conformance_profile` is `MIC-Evidence`, `receipt_policy.level` MUST NOT
be `minimal`.
### 8.17. `tool_manifest_digest`
The `tool_manifest_digest` claim binds the mission to a specific tool
manifest snapshot.
`tool_manifest_digest` MUST be present.
`tool_manifest_digest` MUST be encoded as `sha-256:` plus 64 lowercase
hexadecimal characters.
The digest input MUST be the RFC 8785 canonical UTF-8 encoding of the tool
manifest JSON object.
The tool manifest itself is out of scope for this document.
However, issuer and verifier MUST use byte-equivalent semantic JSON objects
for hashing.
The verifier MUST compare the digest by exact string equality.
If the currently loaded tool manifest hashes to a different digest, the
verifier MUST treat the mission as non-conformant.
The verifier MAY distinguish this case as a `manifest_drift` finding in a
companion error vocabulary.
### 8.18. `revocation_ref`
The `revocation_ref` claim points to the Token Status List resource used for
mission revocation checks.
`revocation_ref` MUST be present.
`revocation_ref` MUST be an HTTPS URI.
`revocation_ref` MUST identify a Token Status List resource and MUST carry a
status-list index in the URI fragment as `#idx=<non-negative-decimal>`.
Example:
`https://status.example.com/mission/2026-04/statuslist.jwt#idx=418`
The fragment-based encoding is used because this version defines only a
single string claim, while the underlying status-list design conceptually
uses a `(uri, idx)` tuple.
The fragment MUST NOT be transmitted when fetching the status list.
The verifier MUST:
1. remove the fragment before performing the HTTP fetch
2. parse the decimal `idx` fragment value
3. use that index against the fetched status list
Issuers MUST NOT encode the index in the query component.
Issuers MUST NOT encode the index in a unique path segment when a shared
status-list URI can be used instead.
These rules reduce avoidable privacy leakage and preserve herd-privacy
properties of shared status lists.
If the fragment is missing or malformed, the MD is invalid.
### 8.19. `approval_policy`
The `approval_policy` claim constrains operator approval throughput.
`approval_policy` MUST be present.
`approval_policy` MUST be an object with exactly one member:
1. `max_approvals_per_hour_per_operator`
`max_approvals_per_hour_per_operator` MUST be a positive integer.
This claim limits approval rate per operator per rolling hour.
If the verifier or approval service cannot establish whether the operator is
within the allowed approval budget, it SHOULD fail closed to
`insufficient_evidence`.
If the operator exceeds the approval budget, the verifier SHOULD fail closed
rather than treating subsequent approvals as automatically valid.
### 8.20. `governed_memory_stores`
The `governed_memory_stores` claim enumerates memory-like stores whose
contents are mission-governed.
`governed_memory_stores` MUST be present.
`governed_memory_stores` MAY be an empty array.
Each member MUST be an object with exactly these members:
1. `store_id`
2. `resource_family`
3. `ttl_s`
4. `integrity_policy`
#### 8.20.1. `store_id`
`store_id` MUST be a non-empty string.
`store_id` SHOULD be stable within the mission lifetime.
`store_id` MAY be a URI, URN, path-like identifier, or other deployment
identifier.
#### 8.20.2. `resource_family`
`resource_family` MUST be a non-empty string.
`resource_family` SHOULD correspond to a `resource_policies[].family` value
when applicable.
#### 8.20.3. `ttl_s`
`ttl_s` MUST be a non-negative integer number of seconds.
`ttl_s = 0` means the store is non-persistent across turns or sessions.
Issuers SHOULD set `ttl_s` to the shortest operationally feasible value.
#### 8.20.4. `integrity_policy`
`integrity_policy` MUST be one of:
1. `digest_bound`
2. `entry_signed`
3. `transparency_logged`
The values mean:
1. `digest_bound`
   The store content or entries are bound to stable content digests.
2. `entry_signed`
   Store entries are individually signed by an authorized producer.
3. `transparency_logged`
   Store writes are transparency logged or equivalently witnessed in an
   append-only integrity system.
If a governed memory store fails its declared integrity policy, the
verifier SHOULD emit a mission violation for that store and SHOULD treat
later reads from the same store as `insufficient_evidence` unless stronger
local recovery logic exists.
### 8.21. `probing_rate_limit`
The `probing_rate_limit` claim limits repeated denied probes against the
policy boundary.
`probing_rate_limit` MUST be present.
`probing_rate_limit` MUST be a positive integer.
The semantic unit is:
`distinct denied attempts per five minutes per agent`
The RECOMMENDED default value is `10`.
If a local authoring tool omits this field before signing, the issuer MUST
inject `10` before producing the signed MD.
The signed MD payload itself MUST contain an explicit integer value.
Verifiers SHOULD track denied probes in a rolling five-minute window keyed
at least by agent subject.
If the probing-rate limit is exceeded, the verifier SHOULD treat subsequent
governed actions as `insufficient_evidence` or `violation` according to
local incident policy.
### 8.22. `idm_extension`
The `idm_extension` claim is OPTIONAL.
If present, it enables an Intent Declaration Message extension profile.
`idm_extension` MUST be an object with exactly these members:
1. `enabled`
2. `intent_schema_ref`
`enabled` MUST be a boolean.
If `enabled` is `true`, `intent_schema_ref` MUST be a non-empty absolute
URI.
If `enabled` is `false`, `intent_schema_ref` MAY be omitted.
If `enabled` is `false` and `intent_schema_ref` is present, verifiers MAY
ignore the reference.
This document does not define the IDM schema itself.
## 9. Processing Rules
### 9.1. Issuer Processing
Before signing an MD, an issuer MUST:
1. construct the full payload object
2. validate it against the closed schema for this version
3. reject unknown top-level or nested members
4. verify `exp > iat`
5. verify `reserved <= ceiling` for each lineage budget entry
6. verify there is exactly one `effect_policies` entry per defined
   side-effect class
7. verify `tool_manifest_digest` matches the issuer's intended tool manifest
8. verify `revocation_ref` uses HTTPS and includes a valid `#idx=` fragment
9. inject `probing_rate_limit = 10` if the authoring layer omitted it
10. sign the payload with ES256
An issuer SHOULD:
1. minimize mission validity windows
2. minimize `max_depth`
3. minimize positive budgets
4. prefer shared status-list URIs over unique per-mission URIs
5. document family and sensitivity taxonomies
### 9.2. Verifier Processing
Before using an MD for authorization, a verifier MUST:
1. verify the ES256 signature
2. decode the payload JSON
3. validate the payload against this specification
4. verify temporal validity
5. verify audience match
6. resolve or consult revocation status
7. verify the locally loaded tool manifest digest if a tool manifest is in
   scope for the action being evaluated
If any required step fails, the verifier MUST reject the MD.
### 9.3. Offline Use
An offline verifier MAY cache:
1. issuer public keys
2. signed MD payloads
3. status-list resources
4. tool manifests
An offline verifier using cached data MUST apply local freshness policy.
If freshness cannot be established for data required by the selected
conformance profile, the verifier SHOULD return `insufficient_evidence`
rather than silently permitting the action.
### 9.4. Telemetry Failure
When evaluating a governed action against an MD:
1. if any field named in `required_telemetry` is missing, the verifier MUST
   return `insufficient_evidence`
2. if required telemetry is structurally present but malformed, the verifier
   MUST return `insufficient_evidence`
3. if the selected conformance profile requires receipts and the receipt is
   missing, the verifier MUST return `insufficient_evidence`
### 9.5. Budget Failure
When evaluating cumulative spend:
1. the verifier MUST initialize mission state from
   `lineage_budgets.per_effect_class`
2. the verifier MUST ensure cumulative consumed plus active descendant
   reservations never exceed `ceiling`
3. the verifier MUST NOT treat `reserved` as the live consumed total
4. a child grant MUST NOT widen any mission ceiling
If an action would exceed the allowed cumulative ceiling, the verifier MUST
fail closed.
### 9.6. Manifest Failure
If the tool manifest digest comparison fails:
1. the verifier MUST treat the action as non-conformant
2. the verifier MUST NOT silently continue on the assumption that the tool
   metadata is equivalent
### 9.7. Revocation Failure
If the verifier cannot retrieve or validate the referenced status list and
the selected conformance profile requires revocation checking for permit
decisions, the verifier SHOULD return `insufficient_evidence`.
If the status list indicates the mission is revoked, the verifier MUST
reject the mission.
### 9.8. Denial-Output Leakage
This document recognizes that denial and evidence-failure responses can
themselves become an oracle.
Deployments SHOULD minimize externally visible denial detail for:
1. `violation`
2. `insufficient_evidence`
Detailed reason codes SHOULD be sent to an audit channel rather than to the
requesting agent when such detail could leak protected information.
## 10. Conformance Requirements
### 10.1. Issuer Conformance
An issuer conforms to MD `v0.1` if it:
1. emits only payloads that satisfy this document
2. signs payloads with ES256
3. rejects unknown members
4. applies RFC 8785 before any hash defined by this document
### 10.2. Verifier Conformance
A verifier conforms to MD `v0.1` if it:
1. verifies ES256 signatures
2. rejects unknown members
3. enforces required telemetry fail-closed behavior
4. enforces mission-level revocation checks
5. enforces tool-manifest digest checks when a tool manifest is available
### 10.3. Profile Conformance
A deployment claiming:
1. `Delegation-Core`
   MUST implement Sections 5, 8, and 9.1 through 9.3.
2. `MIC-State`
   MUST implement `Delegation-Core` and Section 9.5.
3. `MIC-Evidence`
   MUST implement `MIC-State` and Section 9.4, plus receipt completeness
   checks consistent with `receipt_policy.level`.
## 11. Claim Registry Compatibility
### 11.1. AAT Compatibility
The MD is designed to compose with AAT, not to replace it.
This document does not redefine any AAT JWT claim registered in AAT
Section 9.1.
The AAT Section 9.1 registered JWT claims are:
1. `aat_type`
2. `del_depth`
3. `del_max_depth`
4. `par_hash`
The AAT Section 9.1 registered PoP JWT claims are:
1. `aat_id`
2. `aat_tool`
3. `hta`
No MD top-level claim in this document uses any of those names.
### 11.2. Standard JWT Claims
This document intentionally reuses these standard JWT claim names:
1. `iss`
2. `sub`
3. `aud`
4. `iat`
5. `exp`
6. `jti`
That reuse is deliberate and required.
### 11.3. Future Registration
This version does not create a new IANA registry.
If a future standards-track submission registers MD-specific JWT claim
names, that registration SHOULD preserve the semantics defined here or
issue a new version.
## 12. Security Considerations
### 12.1. Tool Metadata Poisoning
The mission is not adequately bound if only tool names are authorized while
tool metadata remains mutable.
`tool_manifest_digest` therefore exists to bind the mission to a specific
manifest snapshot.
Issuers MUST hash the canonical manifest.
Verifiers MUST compare that hash to the live manifest.
### 12.2. Memory Poisoning
Persistent stores can carry adversarial content across turns, sessions, or
delegation hops.
`governed_memory_stores` exists so those stores become first-class governed
resources rather than ambient state.
Issuers SHOULD keep the governed store set small.
Verifiers SHOULD treat failed store-integrity checks as high-severity
findings.
### 12.3. Approval Fatigue
Frequent human approvals can degrade operator judgment and become an attack
surface.
`approval_policy` therefore encodes a mission-level approval-rate ceiling.
Deployments SHOULD couple this claim with operator-identity logging.
### 12.4. Boundary Probing
Repeated denied requests can reveal policy boundaries.
`probing_rate_limit` therefore exists to cap repeated denied probes.
Verifiers SHOULD track semantically distinct denied attempts, not merely raw
request count, to avoid trivial evasion through exact replay.
### 12.5. Revocation Privacy
The Token Status List design uses shared lists to reduce per-token
observability.
This document therefore forbids encoding the status-list index in a query
parameter and requires fragment-based encoding in `revocation_ref`.
### 12.6. Algorithm Confusion
An MD is a signed JWT and is therefore exposed to generic JWT validation
risks.
Issuers and verifiers MUST maintain an explicit algorithm allowlist and MUST
reject `alg: "none"`.
### 12.7. Offline Cache Staleness
Offline-capable verifiers can become stale.
If freshness of required artifacts cannot be established for the selected
profile, the verifier SHOULD return `insufficient_evidence`.
### 12.8. Forward Compatibility
Silent acceptance of unknown fields is dangerous in governance policy
artifacts.
This version therefore forbids unknown top-level and nested members.
## 13. Operational Considerations
### 13.1. Authoring Tools
Authoring tools SHOULD:
1. expose the closed schema to operators before signing
2. inject explicit defaults before signature generation
3. render `reserved` and `ceiling` distinctly so operators do not confuse
   them
### 13.2. Caching
Caches SHOULD key MDs by both `iss` and `jti`.
Caches SHOULD index missions by `mission_id` as a stable lookup key.
Caches MAY retain multiple MD instances with the same `mission_id` and
different `jti` values.
### 13.3. Rotation
If an issuer rotates an MD instance without changing mission semantics:
1. `jti` MUST change
2. `mission_id` SHOULD remain stable
3. `tool_manifest_digest` SHOULD remain stable if the tool manifest is
   unchanged
### 13.4. Transport
Although payload integrity is provided by JWS, transport confidentiality is
still important because MD contents expose mission structure, tool
identifiers, and resource patterns.
Deployments SHOULD use TLS or equivalent transport protection.
## 14. JSON Schema
The normative JSON Schema for this version is:
`docs/spec/mission-declaration-v0.1.schema.json`
The schema is part of the deliverable set for this version.
The schema and this prose specification are intended to agree.
If they diverge, this prose specification takes precedence.
## 15. Examples
This version provides these example payloads:
1. `docs/spec/examples/minimal-md.json`
2. `docs/spec/examples/full-md.json`
The minimal example is intended to show the smallest practical valid MD.
The full example is intended to exercise every optional or extensible
surface, including `idm_extension`.
The full example file is expected to be stored in RFC 8785 canonical byte
form so round-trip checks can compare bytes directly.

## Appendix B. Rationale Notes
### B.1. Why `reserved` Appears in MD
The MD is a policy artifact, not a live ledger.
However, the mission may begin in a partially encumbered state.
The `reserved` field exists to encode that initial encumbrance without
forcing the verifier to guess.
In ordinary root issuance, `reserved` SHOULD be zero.
### B.2. Why `effect_policies` and `lineage_budgets` Are Separate
They govern different failure modes.
`effect_policies.limit` constrains per-event spend.
`lineage_budgets.per_effect_class.*` constrains cumulative spend across the
delegation tree.
Both are required because either one alone is insufficient.
### B.3. Why `revocation_ref` Uses a Fragment
The user requirement for this version is a single `revocation_ref` claim.
The underlying Token Status List design conceptually carries both a URI and
an index.
The fragment preserves a single-string claim while avoiding index leakage in
HTTP query parameters.
### B.4. Why Unknown Fields Are Rejected
Mission policy is a security envelope.
Silent acceptance of unknown fields turns schema drift into ambient
authority.
This version therefore chooses strict versioning over permissive parsing.
## Appendix C. Implementation Checklist
An implementation is ready to interoperate with MD `v0.1` if it can answer
"yes" to all of the following:
1. Does it reject unknown top-level members?
2. Does it reject unknown nested members?
3. Does it sign only with ES256?
4. Does it reject `alg: "none"`?
5. Does it canonicalize with RFC 8785 before hashing?
6. Does it encode digests as `sha-256:` plus lowercase hex?
7. Does it enforce `reserved <= ceiling`?
8. Does it enforce exact coverage of all five side-effect classes?
9. Does it parse `revocation_ref` fragments of the form `#idx=<n>`?
10. Does it fail closed to `insufficient_evidence` when required telemetry is
    missing?
11. Does it prevent receipt-level weakening under `MIC-Evidence`?
12. Does it compare tool-manifest digests by exact string equality?
## Appendix D. Non-Goals
This version does not attempt to:
1. define a global resource-family registry
2. define a global sensitivity-label registry
3. define tool manifest contents
4. define ER error codes
5. define historical revocation semantics
6. define encrypted MD payloads
These are deliberate exclusions from `v0.1`.
