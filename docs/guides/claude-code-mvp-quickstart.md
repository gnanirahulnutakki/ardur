# Claude Code MVP Quickstart

This is the shortest product-facing path through Ardur today from a source
checkout. It is meant for the current pre-release `dev` branch and source
installs; it is not a tagged package-manager release path yet.

Use it in two modes:

- **No-key confidence check:** no Anthropic/OpenAI token required. It verifies
  source/local-wheel install, `ARDUR.md` profile creation, `ardur protect
  claude-code`, `ardur doctor-claude-code`, a simulated Claude Code hook allow
  and deny path, and `ardur claude-code-report` chain verification.
- **Live Claude Code demo:** requires the local `claude` binary to already be
  installed and authenticated. Ardur does not perform login, account changes, or
  provider setup.

## Claim boundary

| Works now | Not claimed | Coming soon |
|---|---|---|
| Source checkout install with Python dependencies. | PyPI/Homebrew/OCI release readiness. | Tagged package-manager release after packaging gates. |
| `ARDUR.md` profile -> Mission Passport -> Claude Code plugin setup. | Visibility into provider-hidden reasoning or server-side tool calls. | More host adapters and proof viewers. |
| Signed Claude Code tool-call receipts with allow/deny/unknown reporting. | Capture of subprocess, kernel, or network side effects below the tool boundary. | Filesystem snapshot and Linux eBPF capture phases. |
| Fresh-user/no-key harness for repeatable local evidence. | Universal support for Codex, Gemini, Kimi, or future CLIs. | Tool-agnostic CLI/kernel capture work. |

## 1. Install from source

From a fresh checkout of this branch:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e python/
ardur --help
```

Keep the virtualenv active for the rest of the walkthrough so Claude Code hooks
can find the same installed `ardur` package.

## 2. Run the no-key evidence harness

This does not call a live LLM provider. It uses temporary HOME, project, Ardur
home, and evidence directories, then writes a redacted shareable bundle.

```bash
python3 scripts/run-rwt-phase1-fresh-user.py \
  --expected-origin-dev "$(git rev-parse --short=12 origin/dev)" \
  --output-dir /tmp/ardur-rwt-phase1

python3 -m json.tool /tmp/ardur-rwt-phase1/bundle.redacted.json | less
```

Expected result for a clean source checkout:

- bundle `status` is `PASS`
- `RWT-1` is `PASS` for install/profile/protect/doctor
- `RWT-2` is `PASS` for actual hook CLI fixture allow/deny receipts
- `RWT-3` is `PASS`, `SKIP_GATED`, or `SKIP_UNSUPPORTED` depending on whether
  a logged-in `claude` binary is available; a skip is the honest no-key result,
  not a hidden failure
- `secret_scan_hits` is `0`
- `raw_secret_values_copied` is `false`

## 3. Run a live Claude Code session

Only run this if `claude` is already installed and logged in. The demo creates a
temporary project and a local `.vibap` home under that project.

```bash
ARDUR_REPO="$(pwd)"
DEMO_PROJECT="$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/ardur-claude-demo.XXXXXX")"
cd "$DEMO_PROJECT"

printf 'alpha\nbeta\ngamma\n' > notes.txt
export VIBAP_HOME="$DEMO_PROJECT/.vibap"

ardur profile init --template read-only --path ARDUR.md
ardur protect claude-code \
  --profile ARDUR.md \
  --home "$VIBAP_HOME" \
  --plugin-dir "$ARDUR_REPO/plugins/claude-code"
ardur doctor-claude-code \
  --home "$VIBAP_HOME" \
  --plugin-dir "$ARDUR_REPO/plugins/claude-code"

VIBAP_HOME="$VIBAP_HOME" claude \
  --plugin-dir "$ARDUR_REPO/plugins/claude-code" \
  -p "Use Read to summarize notes.txt. Do not edit files or run shell commands."

ardur claude-code-report --home "$VIBAP_HOME"
```

The report should find the receipt chain under
`$VIBAP_HOME/claude-code-hook/<trace_id>/receipts.jsonl`, verify signatures and
chain links, and summarize compliant, violation, and unknown outcomes. If the
model attempts `Bash`, `Edit`, or `Write`, the read-only profile should return a
Claude Code deny decision and still preserve the signed violation receipt.

## 4. Read the result correctly

Ardur evidence is strongest at the local tool boundary. Treat the report as a
verified statement about what Claude Code exposed to local hooks and what Ardur
allowed, denied, or could not see. Do not use it to claim provider-internal
reasoning visibility, complete shell side-effect capture, production eBPF
coverage, or package-manager release readiness.
